# CTIS TAXII Splunk App Documentation

This Splunk app provides threat intelligence sharing capabilities to support the ASD's Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing (CTIS) platform.
This app specifically allows security teams to curate IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) from ingested Splunk events, which can be submitted as STIX v2.1 bundles via the TAXII v2.1 protocol over HTTPS.
